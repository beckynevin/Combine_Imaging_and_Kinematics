# Combine_Imaging_and_Kinematics
This code implements a random forest regressor followed by a linear discriminant analysis to select the kinematic and imaging predictors that are most informative for classifying galaxies.

It also runs various statistical tests and makes diagnostic plots to examine the training data; it does so to assess between-class fairness.

Here is the output, a selection of leading terms for each run, heatmap-style.
